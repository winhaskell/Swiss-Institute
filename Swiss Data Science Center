In 2017, a national Data Science initiative from the ETH Board resulted in the creation of a unique joint venture 
between EPFL and ETH Zurich: the Swiss Data Science Center. 

The Centerâ€™s mission is to accelerate the use of data science and machine learning techniques within academic disciplines 
of the ETH Domain, the Swiss academic community at large, and the industrial sector.
