Swiss Software Industry Survey

The software industry is an important engine of growth for advanced economies like Switzerland. 
Yet, we know little about the national software industry. 
The Swiss Software Industry Survey (SSIS) aims at gradually closing this gap.

The Swiss Software Industry Survey (SSIS) is conducted by the Institute of Information Systems at the University of Bern
and supported by Swico and Dr. Sieber & Partners.

The SSIS is led by Dr. Thomas Hurni and Prof. Dr. Jens Dibbern and is part of the dissertations of Simon Perrelet and Corinna Rutschi.

At the same time, the SSIS replaces the already well-known Swiss Software Industry Index (SSII) of 
the Bern-based consulting firm Dr. Pascal Sieber & Partners AG.
